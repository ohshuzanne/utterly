#CONTEXT ABOUT THE PROJECT:

i'm making a  web-based application that allows:

1. users to upload their chatbot API 
2. access a "drag n drop" schema where they can create questions and put in their ideal/expected answer
3. start the workflow
4. allow the chatbot to be tested on 30 different iterations of the same question in the workflow, coming up with a final report on accuracy, as well as point out inaccuracies that can be concerning/instances of hallucination

#STACK
Frontend - Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, Typescript, shadcn/ui and Aceternity. Any relevant libraries
Backend - Python (I need to create my own API to test the chatbot), any other relevant tools
DB - Prisma PostgreSQL
